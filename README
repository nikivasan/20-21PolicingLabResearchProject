## Research Project

>This repo holds the research projects I have worked on in [Fall 2020](https://github.com/nikivasan/PolicingLabResearch/tree/master/Fall2020) and [Spring 2021](https://github.com/nikivasan/PolicingLabResearch/tree/master/Spring2021). Each project has a respective README file that 
provides a summary of the work that was done and the results. Fall 2020's research focused more on understanding the spatial concentration of police use-of-force 
incidients in relationship to minority concentrations in urban counties. In Spring 2021, we pivoted to look more into the efficacy of police de-escalation training on
decreasing severe use-of-force incidents, particularly against minority victims, using New Jersey as a case study. 

Both projects were collaborative, with due credit given to my partners Mengxuan Yan (Fall and Spring) and Jon Marcus (Spring).
