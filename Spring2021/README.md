# PolicingLabResearch Spring 2021

During this semester, we looked at the efficacy of police de-escalation training on decreasing use-of-force incidents. We were tasked with replicating a [study](https://file.groupme.com/v1/66322847/files/b044021d-d60d-484a-9f3a-e00a28f030f4) 
by Li Sian Goh of the University of Pennsylvania that used Camden, New Jersey as a case study to determine if de-escalation successfully reduced serious use-of-force incidents. 
To determine department-wide effects of the training, the study used a synthetic control analysis that compared Camden's serious use-of-force rates and use-of-force rates 
(operationalized in the study) with a weighted average of other major cities in New Jersey. The technique is described below:

>The synthetic control method, pioneered by Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2010), is a
method of counterfactual estimation which constructs a synthetic control unit similar to the treatment unit on observable preintervention outcomes... In the context of a department-level intervention, a synthetic Camden, composed of a weighted
average of other municipal New Jersey departments that have not implemented such training, is created for comparison purposes. Each department is assigned an analytic weight, so that the difference in the preintervention outcome between the treated department (CCPD) and its synthetic
control is minimized. 

Our task was to replicate the analysis and observe if there any variations in the conclusions for White, Black, and Hispanic subjects. The original study also
divided the numbers by per 1000 arrests, which we also removed to determine if a decrease in the use-of-force rate was attributed to an increase in arrests. 
Ultimately, the goal of this research was largely discovery and in service of extending the research on this topic.
